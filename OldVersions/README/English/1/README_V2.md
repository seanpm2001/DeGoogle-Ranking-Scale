The DeGoogle ranking is a 1-10 scale of how far one is willing to go to rid their life of Google. It is also used to determine the level of DeGoogling an article about Google is.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how much of a DeGoogler are you?

- **Level 1:** _Google Fanatic_ - Not worried about DeGoogling at all, will go for every Google product and service, and possibly go against DeGooglers
- **Level 2:** _Google Cautious_ - A little worried about Google, will rid their life of some Google services, but not all. Will still use some Google Services, and may or may not block Google trackers
- **Level 3:** _Google Anxious_ - Worried about Google, and will rid their life of Google services up to their comfort level.
- **Level 4:** _Meek Anti-Google_ - Will cut out as many Google products from their life as they can, and possibly turn down jobs that use Google services
- **Level 5:** _Weak Anti-Google_ - Will cut out all Google products from their life, except for difficult ones to get rid of, such as YouTube, or Android
- **Level 6:** _Medium Anti-Google_ - Will cut out all Google products from their life, and will actively try to avoid Android and YouTube as well
- **Level 7:** _DeGoogler_ - Successfully cut out all Google products from their life, and will prevent themselves from getting into any other Google products
- **Level 8:** _DeGoogler strong_ - Has cut out all Google products from their life, not trying new Google services, and actively avoiding other services that have a strong emphasis on Google functionality. Will even turn down job offers that involve usage of Google products and services.
- **Level 9:** _Strict DeGoogler_ - Has cut out all Google products from their life, avoids all possible connections and pings to Google, won't use Google services, actively avoids sites that have a strong emphasis on Google functionality, will even block Google fonts and graphics
- **Level 10**: _Pure anti-Google_ - Will go to the point where they won't enter a different room or building that uses Google products or services, or displays the word Google anywhere. Will not use anything Google, even fonts and graphics, will turn down Google related jobs, will go the point of total social isolation to prevent Google from entering their lives.

> **Note** It is not recommended to go above level 9. Level 10 is the strictest level, and is considered unhealthy

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, over 25 translations are out of date and are using Version 8 or Version 9 of this README file. A translator is needed. Also, as ofApril 1st 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

🎌️ **Flag guide** 🎌️

🚩️🏴️🏳️ Flags were beginning to get added in version 2 of this document. I was originally just going to add the Ukraine 🇺🇦️ flag, but decided to add more, until every language had at least 1 flag. They were done purely with the existing knowledge of the developer. In version 3, flags were added for every language. There are some notes that go with this:

🌐️ **[Unions `🇪🇺️` and Nations `🇺🇳️`]** 🌐️

Languages listed here that are official languages of the European Union have a European Union flag `🇪🇺️` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 27 languages recognized by the European Union, from 27 different member states.

Languages listed here that are official languages of the United Nations have a United Nations flag `🇺🇳️` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 6 languages recognized by the European Union (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish) alongside 193 different member states and 2 observer states.

🌏️ **[One China (PRC) `🇨🇳️` Two China (Taiwan) `🇹🇼️` Hong Kong `🇭🇰️` and Macau `🇲🇴️`]** 🌏️

For neutrality reasons, languages listed here that have an official majority in Chinese speakers will receive all 4 of these flags, even if the language isn't Chinese or in the Sino family of languages.

🌐️ **[Global languages `🌐️`]** 🌐️

Currently, 1 global language is listed, and that is Esperanto. Esperanto is not native to any countries, its goal is to be a universal _lingua franca_ (Latin translation: _bridge language_) it is represented with a `globe with meridians` or `🌐️`

💞️ **[Regarding sexuality 🏳️‍🌈️]** 💞️

Sexuality is not measured here, I feel it would be unnecessary, as you are picking out a language, not a sexuality.

💠️ **[Location of flag 🚩️]** 💠️

Flags are located at the end of each language name (after the Romanization) with one space before, to the right.

Like this:

**[Pl Polski Polish 🇵🇱️]**

But not like this:

**[Pl Polski 🇵🇱️ Polish]**

And also not like this:

**[Pl 🇵🇱️ Polski Polish]**

🏁️ **End of flag guide** 🏁️

**2022.03.12**

I was so angry and frustrated. I didn't save the file, and my computer randomly froze up twice, then crashed. I had to re-add all the flags, it took an hour to do so originally, and I was just seconds away from finishing. I couldn't save the file quick enough. Luckily, all the research was still in my head, and there was no data that wasn't easily replacable (identically) so it is a type of important work that was the best thing to lose, since it was the easiest to recreate, taking me less than 20 minutes

**Other notes:**

⚠️ A language is missing: `Latvian`

ℹ️ Possibly supporting the next 126 languages that are going to be added to Google Translate

🗜️ Plans to automate this process with the [`@AUTOMATE2001`](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001) bot

⛔️ Need to find a way to work with these languages on services other than Google Translate.

⚠️ There might be noticeable lag in this section due to how many flag emojis are in use.
